        <h3>Our Sponsor</h3>
        <p>Our team has been working with TechAide, an organization based in Ghana that aims to promote economic and educational opportunities throughout Africa. TechAide has built a product called Asanka which is a content storage and management solution for classrooms. Asanka is an operating system that runs on a RaspberryPi and serves as an offline content storage device for classrooms in Ghana where internet access is scarce. With Asanka, teachers and students are able to access documents and files as well as store any personal files they may have created during a classroom activity. </p>

        <h3>Our Project</h3>
        <p>In the initial version of Asanka, teachers and administrators are able to access files using one large shared space. While the first version of Asanka is functional and serves its purpose, TechAide wanted to improve the user interface to make using the device a better experience for teachers. One of the main issues with the first design of Asanka is that when there are many files stored on the device, it is difficult to find a specific file due to the lack of organization of content. Our solution for this problem is to organize the content on the device into folders by class subject and grade level. In addition, we have chosen to give each teacher their own folder for files specific to their class. The two main goals for our redesign were to make it easier for users to find content on Asanka and to create a more personalized experience for the teachers.</p>

        <p>In our new version of the Asanka user interface, content is organized into different categories, and each teacher has their own folder on the device for their content. This redesign is meant to empower teachers to use technology more often in the classroom by giving them control and ownership over part of the device. Our working prototype was built using Node.js, React.js, Firebase, and Bootstrap for styling. In addition to this redesign, we have created user profiles for TechAide to aid in future designs and iterations. We have also been helping TechAide with some small security fixes, offering advice about device security and accessibility. </p>

                            By organizing the content on Asanka into different groups based on subject, grade level, and teacher, we have made content easier to find.

                            Giving each teacher their own folder on Asanka gives them a greater sense of ownership over the device and will encourage more technology use in the classroom.
